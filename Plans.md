# Plans for HxWebView 0.1.0

- Window Examples will be unified in one called "WebView Window Manipulation"
- Cleaner code
- More features
- Macros for converting a normal function into a bind automatically (Might need help with this one or just delay it)
- Rewritten the whole codebase
- Full control over the WebView owned Window

# Done so far

- More control over the GTK Main Loop (Manual Loop, still in development)
